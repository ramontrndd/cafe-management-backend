In this project, a basic cafeteria system's back-end was developed using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The next step is to develop the front-end using Angular 17, a web application development framework. With the front-end, users will be able to interact in a friendly and intuitive manner with the system, allowing them to perform operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting items from the cafeteria menu, providing a comprehensive experience to customers and facilitating the management of the establishment.
